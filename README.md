THE CRYPTO CLICKER GAME
IST351 WEB DEVELOPMENT 2 FALL 2022
Made by Jarrett Nobles, Jonathan Warren, and Tanner Scott

This is a website that lets you play and mine for a fake crypto currency. 
This project was taken from web development 1 and used for our server side web development class.
We added a lot of database interaction, implemented AJAX and PHP. This project was developed on a Google LAMP stack.

Other features include: Being able to upgrade your graphics card, buying crypto auto miners, implementing a leader board, and we added some helpful resources to learn more about crypto currency that you can unlock with the points you earn. The database will also save everything you have bought and when you log back in you will still have your scores.

This was not implemented on my personal Google Cloud machine, but if anyone would like to play it feel free to send me an email noblesjarrett035@gmail.com
